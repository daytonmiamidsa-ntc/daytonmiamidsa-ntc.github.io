While the DSA of Dayton-Miami Valley has not formally endorsed any candidate or issue, the executive committee has thoroughly discussed Issues 1 and 2. We strongly urge a 'No' vote on Issues 1 and 2.

Issue 1 would give the gerrymandered GOP supermajority power to dictate cash bail conditions and take it away from judges.
Issue 2 would amend Ohio's constitution to restrict voting for 17 year olds in Ohio's primaries, eviscerate Home Rule, and suppress future votes.

Additionally, while the chapter has not endorsed in favor of any candidate through a formal process, it should go without saying: do not give those fascists in the GOP a single vote. Their stranglehold on - and abuse of - power must be checked.

The GOP have ignored the Ohio Constitution, placed extreme restrictions on abortion access, passed bills to threaten trans students (and any student believed to be trans) with genital exams, introduced a "Don't Say Gay" bill, and are flirting with a contraception ban.

The GOP candidates for statewide legislative, executive, and judicial posts are a threat to the continuation of democratic elections, the right to peaceful protest, and so much more in Ohio.

The executive committee strongly urges you to vote AGAINST the entire GOP slate.
