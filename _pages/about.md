You don’t have to live in the Miami Valley area to get involved in Dayton-Miami Valley DSA. We welcome all who want to make a difference.

### I joined DSA. Now how do I get involved?

Welcome, comrade! We’re glad you asked! DSA is primarily a member-volunteer organization. While there is a small national staff, most of DSA’s work is done at a local chapter level by members like you.

Your first step to getting involved in the Dayton-Miami Valley DSA should be to join our Slack channel, which is where most of our internal communications take place.

Please email us at <{{ site.data.social.email.url }}>, using the email address you used to pay dues, so we can get you added to Slack! Also, join the [mailing list](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/dayton-miami-valley-dsa-interests-activism-survey) if you haven’t already.

### How should I use Slack?

Slack is a messaging app that serves as our primary means of internal communications.

Here are a few guidelines for using Slack:

- While some members may choose not to use their full names due to security concerns, we ask all members to use a name we can associate you with, so we know with whom we are talking.
- Please include your preferred pronouns in parentheses in your name (if you feel comfortable doing so).
- Introduce yourself in the *#introductions* channel.
- Feel free to turn off notifications or mute channels you aren’t interested in so you don’t get overwhelmed.
- Check out the channels for the working groups you’re most interested in and see how you can get involved!
- Keep it comradely. Please refrain from any hostility and contact our Grievance Officer if you have any concerns.
- Please do your best to post in the most appropriate channels and avoid spamming the chapter with anything that might not be relevant. If you are unsure, feel free to post in the #random channel to figure out the best path forward.

### How is Dayton-Miami Valley DSA organized?

Dayton-Miami Valley is a democratically organized member organization. All members in good standing are eligible to run and/or vote for elected officer roles. Regular elections are held at our annual general meetings (in February), and each position has a one-year term. The elected officers are:

- Two Co-Chairs
- Treasurer
- Social Media Coordinator
- Secretary

Officers also designate a chapter Grievance Officer from among qualified members in good standing.

If members wish to contact any chapter leaders, they should first attempt to do so via Slack.

### What is a Dayton-Miami Valley working group?

A working group is a permanent or ad-hoc subgroup within Dayton-Miami Valley DSA focused on a particular issue or ongoing project. We have dedicated discussion channels for each working group on the Slack.

In addition, any member in good standing may propose the creation of new working groups, and Slack is the best place to initiate those conversations.

Our permanent working groups currently include the following:

- Abolition
- Electoral
- Housing Justice
- Communication
- Labor

### Are there also national DSA working groups?

Yes! You can learn more about the national DSA working groups here: National Working Groups. Getting involved in national working groups is a great way to contribute directly to DSA’s efforts on federal issues, while also helping to keep our local chapter’s efforts well-coordinated with those of other chapters across the country.

### How do I change my contact information or dues payment options?

Contact <mailto:membership@dsausa.org> to change the email address associated with your membership.

You can fill out a form on this page if you need to update your mailing address: [Change Your Address](https://act.dsausa.org/survey/mailingaddr/).

Make sure you submit the address change form using the email address associated with your membership. When you receive the email confirming the change, it won’t actually include your updated information. You can email <mailto:membership@dsausa.org> if you want confirmation of the change, and you can also request a new confirmation email with your updated information.

### Someone in the chapter is harassing me. What can I do?

Dayton-Miami Valley DSA is committed to creating a space that is welcoming and inclusive to members of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and other identity groups. We do not tolerate harassment, abuse, or harm in any form. If you experience any form of harassment from a member, please contact our chapter’s Grievance Officer.

Dayton-Miami Valley DSA adheres to DSA’s national harassment policy and grievance process: [DSA Harassment and Grievance Policy](https://www.dsausa.org/about-us/harassment-policy-resolution-33/)
