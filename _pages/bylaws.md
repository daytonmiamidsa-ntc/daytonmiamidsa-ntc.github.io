*Adopted September 25, 2018; approved by the NPC DATE*

## ARTICLE I. Name.

The name of the Local Chapter will be the Dayton-Miami Valley Local Chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. DSA is a not-for-profit corporation.

## ARTICLE II. Purpose.

DSA Dayton-Miami Valley seeks to facilitate the transition to a truly democratic and socialist society, one in which the means/resources of production are democratically and
socially controlled.

DSA rejects an economic order based solely on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination in all forms, including, but not limited to that based on race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and brutality and violence in defense of
the status quo.

DSA envisions a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, gender and racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships.

Our conception of socialism is a profoundly democratic one. It is rooted in the belief that human beings should be free to develop to their fullest potential, that public policies should be determined not by wealth but by popular participation, and that individual liberties should be carefully safeguarded. It is committed to a freedom of speech that does not recoil from dissent, to a freedom to organize independent trade unions, women’s groups, political parties, and other formations -- recognizing these as essential bulwarks against the dangers of an intrusive state. It is committed to a freedom of religion that acknowledges the rights of those for whom spiritual concerns are central.

We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision. In the present, we are building a visible socialist presence within the broad democratic left. In the long run, we hope to build a majority movement capable of making democratic socialism a reality in the United States. Our strategy acknowledges the class structure of the U.S. society. This class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.
